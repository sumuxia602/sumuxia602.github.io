  in this article, we aggressively allow incorrect backups to occur and propose a backup error detection method and a fault-tolerant backup management to guarantee the correctness of the systemâ€™s execution. To augment the parallel backup method, an adaptive execution method is further proposed to reduce the number of backups and balance the ratio between task execution time and backup latency.
