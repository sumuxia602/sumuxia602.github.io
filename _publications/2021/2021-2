  wIn this work, we propose an approach to enable a system to use volatile SRAM to correctly progress in the presence of transient power failures, since SRAM is capable of retaining its data for seconds or minutes with the charge remained in the battery/capacitor after the CPU core stops at its brown-out voltage.
