  We propose a resource-efficient and flexible micro-architectural design for HE operations, where data access patterns in various pipeline execution stages are optimized for high memory bandwidth utilization. Furthermore, a memory-aware performance model is built for automatic design space exploration for cryptosystem parameter selection and hardware resource provisioning.
