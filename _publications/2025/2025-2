  We propose, to the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, the first static timing analysis framework for CNN inference in a multi-DPU environment. The proposed framework introduces a generalized timing behavior model for shared bus arbitration and memory access contention between parallel running DPU engines. Additionally, it incorporates a fine-grained memory access contention analysis that takes into account the characteristics of deep learning applications.
