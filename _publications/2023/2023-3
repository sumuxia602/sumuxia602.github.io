  This paper presents an approach to increase the success rate of firmware update on energy-harvesting IoT devices. The main idea is to first conduct a lightweight flash write with reduced erase/write time (and thus less energy consumed) to quickly save the new firmware image to flash memory before a power failure occurs. To ensure a long data retention time, a reinforcement step follows to re-write the new firmware image on the flash with default erase/write configuration when the system is not busy and has free energy.
