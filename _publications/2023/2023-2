  In this work, we demonstrate that deployment of multiple heterogeneous DPU engines makes better resource efficiency for a given FPGA device. Moreover, we show that pipelined execution of a CNN inference task over heterogeneous multi-DPU engines may further improve overall inference throughput with carefully designed CNN layers-to-DPU mapping and scheduling.
