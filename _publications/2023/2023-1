  This paper explores how to schedule energy to optimize the information freshness in wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) when considering channel interference among adjacent sensor nodes. We introduce Age of Information (AoI) to quantitatively evaluate the information freshness and formulate the AoI optimization problem.
