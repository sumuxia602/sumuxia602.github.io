  In this paper, we point out that although cache delays updates to the main memory, it may preserve a recoverable system state in the main memory. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a cache-aware task decomposition method that divides an application into multiple tasks, ensuring that no dirty cache lines are evicted during their execution.
